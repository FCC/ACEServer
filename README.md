# ACE Quill Server
ACE Quill is an open-source, test platform, mobile caption phone prototype to support device operability and usability assessments. The test platform prototype uses the speech-to-text (STT) application programming interfaces (API) available from Google Speech, IBM Watson, and Microsoft Bing Speech to support usability studies. The prototype enables direct calling by Deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals, automatically transcribing and captioning all audio from the called person for presentation to the Deaf and hard-of-hearing caller.

The ACE Quill Server is comprised of two applications:
* [An Asterisk PBX](./asterisk/README.md)
* [A Node.js web application built with the Express framework](./node_server/README.md)
